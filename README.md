# DataStack-in-a-Box
DataStack-in-a-Box is a self-managed, on-premise open-source data platform built entirely using Docker. It brings together key components of a modern data stack in a modular and lightweight architecture. The platform uses MinIO as the storage layer, Trino and DuckDB as execution engines, Airflow for orchestration, dbt for transformation, and Metabase for visualization. 
To support streamlined development and deployment, GitLab is integrated for CI/CD. This project was designed to be scalable, cost-effective, and easily reproducibleâ€”ideal for teams or individuals looking to run a complete data platform locally or in a controlled environment without relying on fully managed cloud services.
